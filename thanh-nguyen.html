				<h6>Personal Website</h6>

				<h6>Personal Information</h6>
				<p>My full name is Thanh Nguyen Trong or most of my friends know it in Vietnamese as Nguyễn Trọng Thành. I’m currently a first-year, first-semester student enrolling at RMIT University Vietnam, majoring in Information Technology and my student ID is s3818993. About my background, I spent my formative years in Hanoi, Vietnam but came to Ho Chi Minh City about three months ago to study and also to start a new life. During the high school years, I used to pursue graphic design professionally, participating in extracurricular activities, projects, events and so on. Because of that, when applying to universities, my friends thought I would choose a design-related major. But due to a change of heart at the last minute, combines with the support of my brother, who is a National University of Singapore (NUS) alumnus majoring in Computer Science, I switched to Information Technology. But still, despite all of that, I still maintain my love for graphic design and arts in general. I enjoy drawing and doing creative design in my leisure time. It is a good change of air once in a while to help with the constant pressure from work at school. And of course, because of my background in design, my interest in IT would lies at web design, UI/UX design, front-end web development, and to ensure a seamless experience for the user. Additionally, I find the information security sector to pique my interest. Moreover, I have little to no experience in IT other than some basics in Python alongside with HTML & CSS.</p>

				<h6>Team Profile</h6>
				<p>The result of three personality tests:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test: Executive — ESTJ-T</li>
					<li>Online Learning Style: Visual Learner</li>
					<!-- <li>Emotional Intelligence Test: Empathy 25/25, Self-awareness 24/25, Adaptability 23/25, Positive Outlook 15/25, Emotional Self-control 15/25</li> -->
					
					<li>Emotional Intelligence Test:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Empathy 25/25</li>
							<li>Self-awareness 24/25</li>
							<li>Adaptability 23/25</li>
							<li>Positive Outlook 15/25</li>
							<li>Emotional Self-control 15/25</li>
						</ul>


				</ul>
				
				<p>From what I have gathered from the results, I am the bringer of order and stability. I believe lawfulness is the foundation of everything, it is what truly matters the most. The presence of authority is the gateway to success. And as an extrovert, the center of the party is where I am, where I will be enjoying drawing all the attention I could get. All of this information concludes my strengths and position in a team. First, my meticulous planning means that I would keep track of the work progress constantly, making sure the group is on the right track and no one is missing the deadlines. And if there is, I would ready to dive into that burdensome project, give them a helping hand instead of just giving out punishment mindlessly. Second, I am capable of socializing and keeping all the members together, bonding them closer, ensuring that there are no distances or hard feelings between my teammates. This keeps the group’s morale up high and outlook be positive. Because, if neglected, consequences would be extremely demoralizing and potentially reducing work efficiency. Third and finally, as a believer in true dedication and perfectionism, I make sure the work of myself and the others are met with high-performance standards; typos and errors must be non-existence, everything guarantees to be of high quality.</p>

				<h6>Ideal Job</h6>
				<p>Job title: Front-end Web Developer</p>
				<p>Looking at the ideal jobs of each member, all of them are widely different from one to the other. About my job, it will mainly involve dealing with the client-side of the web application. Designing and planning to ensure good user experience. Proficiency in HTML & CSS, with knowledge in using JavaScript and its frameworks. Some other tasks are cross-browser and mobile development, translating photoshop document files to a real web page, debugging, maintaining the website and so forth.</p>
